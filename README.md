# Covid 19 AWS Data Warehosuing

## Introduction
In the aftermath of the COVID-19 pandemic, healthcare systems worldwide have struggled with shortages in beds, supplies, and staff. Dealing with such emergencies requires a good understanding of the situation and quick decisions. To handle the massive amount of data involved, traditional methods like on-premises data storage aren't enough. That's where cloud technology comes in. It's like a supercharged tool that can store and analyze a lot of data effectively. Our project focuses on using the cloud to help healthcare systems better manage and understand crises.

## Problem Definition
Analyzing the extensive data generated by COVID cases and available medical supplies is crucial. It's essential to do this in a way that's both quick and efficient in terms of computing. To manage this data effectively, we're searching for solutions that can handle large amounts of information and are strong and reliable. Our suggestion is to utilize cloud-based warehouses to store, process, and examine the daily COVID data. Our goal is to identify patterns and gain insights into trends as part of our project.

## Data Overview
Dataset: https://aws.amazon.com/covid-19-data-lake/
Dataset consists of 10 tables, that include - vaccination distribution, COVID cases (confirmed cases, deaths), New York state and county details, NY daily testing details, hospital beds data, a few lookup country and state tables that contain abbreviationâ€™s.

## ETL Pipeline and Data Warehouse
The architecture involves a series of steps, from data collection to visualization:

Data Ingestion: Data is fetched from the AWS Data Lake. This data is then uploaded to the S3 bucket.

Data Storage:The collected data is stored in an AWS S3 bucket. 

Data Transformation: AWS Glue jobs are used to transform the data. A pyspark script has been deployed to perform the union operation combines data from different sources to transform in the required data warehouse.

Data Analysis: AWS Athena is employed to perform SQL-based querying on the transformed data.

Data Visualization: AWS Athena is connected to Tableau for creating insightful dashboards that present the analyzed data visually.
  
## Conclusion
The COVID-19 Data Pipeline project demonstrates a holistic method for managing and analyzing pandemic-related data using cloud-based solutions. Through the collection, transformation, analysis, and visualization of the data, we empower healthcare professionals and organizations to extract valuable insights into pandemic trends and the impact on public health.
